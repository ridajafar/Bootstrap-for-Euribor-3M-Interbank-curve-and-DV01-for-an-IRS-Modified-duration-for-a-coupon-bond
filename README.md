# Bootstrap-for-Euribor-3M-Interbank-curve-and-DV01-for-an-IRS-Modified-duration-for-a-coupon-bond


"This repository presents a comprehensive collection of financial modeling and analysis tasks. Here's an overview of the main components:

1. **Case Study: Bootstrap for Euribor 3M Interbank Curve**
   - Develop a MATLAB code to perform bootstrap for the Discount Factors' curve, using a single-curve model.
   - Generate output values based on settlement dates and expiries of quoted underlyings.
   - Utilize spline interpolation to create a complete set of swap rates from provided data.
   - Explore the significance of the bootstrap technique in obtaining Discount Factors (DFs) from quoted rates in the finance domain.

2. **Exercise: DV01 and Modified Duration Calculation**
   - Calculate DV01 (parallel shift), DV01(z) (parallel shift), and BPV for a 6-year plain vanilla IR swap against Euribor 3m, with specific parameters.
   - Compute the Macaulay Duration for an "I.B. coupon bond" with similar characteristics as the IRS.
   - Analyze and comment on the results of these calculations.

3. **Theoretical Exercise: Pricing a 7-Year "I.B. Coupon Bond"**
   - Price a 7-year "I.B. coupon bond" issued on January 31, 2023, with a coupon rate equal to the corresponding mid-market 7-year swap rate.
   - Assume a 30/360 European day count convention.
   - Provide shortcuts and methods for pricing this bond.

This repository serves as a valuable resource for those interested in financial modeling, curve bootstrapping, interest rate swaps, and bond valuation, offering practical code and theoretical exercises for analysis and learning."
